# Hello-World
This is my first repository.
And this is the first branch of the first repository.
I am a student of Jilin University in China, majoring in software project.
I have learned four types of programming languages, which include Python, Java, C and C++, and meanwhile I am leaning DeepLearning from bilibili website, the Andrew Ng's course.
Though, having learnt that much of knowledge of programming, this is my first try to create my repository, and I hope there will be one day that I heartly feel my naive youth writing this README.md.
Keep learning, and let nature take its course bravely.

The tutorail taught me to write the changes of the main branch, emmm, nothing changed to write ahout I think...
